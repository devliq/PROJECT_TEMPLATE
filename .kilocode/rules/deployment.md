# Deployment Rules

## Deployment Strategies

- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Use rolling updates for gradual rollout of changes
- Apply canary releases for testing new features with subset of users
- Consider feature flags for controlled feature activation
- Plan rollback strategies for quick recovery from failed deployments

## CI/CD Pipelines

- Automate build, test, and deployment processes
- Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for pipeline orchestration
- Implement automated testing gates before production deployment
- Maintain separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with promotion workflows
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent environment setup

## Containerization and Orchestration

- Use Docker for application containerization
- Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling
- Define Helm charts for application packaging and deployment
- Use container registries for secure image storage and distribution
- Implement health checks and readiness probes for containers

## Cloud Deployment Best Practices

- Leverage cloud-native services (AWS ECS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE)
- Implement auto-scaling based on metrics and load
- Use managed databases and storage services
- Configure proper security groups and network policies
- Monitor deployment metrics and set up alerting for issues

## Infrastructure Management

- Use Terraform or CloudFormation for infrastructure provisioning
- Implement configuration management with Ansible or Puppet
- Maintain immutable infrastructure where possible
- Use service meshes (Istio, Linkerd) for traffic management
- Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures
