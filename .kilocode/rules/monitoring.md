# Monitoring Rules

## Logging Standards

- Use structured logging with consistent formats across all components
- Include contextual information (user ID, request ID, timestamps) in logs
- Implement log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) appropriately
- Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use centralized logging solutions for distributed systems

## Metrics Collection

- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to business goals
- Monitor system health metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O)
- Implement custom business metrics for application-specific monitoring
- Use tools like Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
- Establish baseline metrics and set up anomaly detection

## Alerting and Notifications

- Define clear alerting thresholds based on historical data
- Implement multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Avoid alert fatigue by prioritizing critical alerts
- Include actionable information in alert messages
- Regularly review and tune alerting rules

## Observability Practices

- Implement distributed tracing for request flow visibility
- Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for trace analysis
- Monitor application dependencies and external service health
- Establish service level objectives (SLOs) and service level indicators (SLIs)
- Conduct regular post-mortem reviews for incidents

## Dashboard and Visualization

- Create comprehensive dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Use tools like Grafana for visualization and alerting
- Ensure dashboards are accessible to relevant stakeholders
- Include historical trends and comparison views
- Automate dashboard updates and maintenance

## Incident Response

- Document incident response procedures and escalation paths
- Implement automated incident detection and initial triage
- Maintain incident response playbooks for common scenarios
- Conduct regular incident response drills and training
- Track incident metrics and continuous improvement
