# Project Standards and Best Practices

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle - avoid knowledge duplication
- Apply YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) - don't write code for future scenarios that may never come
- Keep functions small and focused - each function should do one thing well
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express their purpose
- Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Write self-documenting code with clear, concise comments when necessary

## Code Structure and Organization

- Organize code into logical modules and packages
- Separate concerns into appropriate directories
- Keep the project structure flat - avoid deep nesting beyond 5-6 levels
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions (avoid spaces, use camelCase or kebab-case)

## Error Handling and Logging

- Implement proper error handling for all functions
- Use appropriate logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Don't suppress or ignore errors without proper handling
- Provide meaningful error messages that help with debugging
