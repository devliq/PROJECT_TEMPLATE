# Performance Rules

## Optimization Techniques

- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Use caching strategies (in-memory, CDN, browser caching)
- Minimize network requests and payload sizes
- Implement lazy loading for images and components
- Optimize images and assets (compression, formats)
- Use code splitting and tree shaking for JavaScript bundles

## Profiling and Monitoring

- Use browser developer tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools) for performance analysis
- Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Datadog
- Monitor key performance metrics (page load time, time to interactive, Core Web Vitals)
- Set up performance budgets and alerts for regressions
- Conduct regular performance audits and benchmarking

## Best Practices

- Optimize critical rendering path for faster page loads
- Implement progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
- Use content delivery networks (CDNs) for global distribution
- Optimize server response times and database performance
- Implement efficient error handling to prevent performance degradation
- Regularly update dependencies for performance improvements
- Conduct load testing to ensure scalability under traffic

## Tools and Automation

- Integrate performance testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Use tools like Lighthouse for automated performance audits
- Implement WebPageTest or GTmetrix for detailed performance analysis
- Use webpack-bundle-analyzer for bundle size optimization
- Automate performance regression testing with tools like Sitespeed.io
